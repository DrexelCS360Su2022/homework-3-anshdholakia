Problem 1: 45 min
It took sometime to go over the program and look at each function. Doing so, it took a lot of time and effort. But after going over each function, I got to understand that adding the symbols to the list of primitives will do the job. But for the last (error) part, I was having some trouble and aborting the evaluator after printing the message. But I did that by just printing the message as we had to abort the evaluator but not the program.

Problem 2: 30 min
This was quite easy but the add function was tricky since the last element which was not evaluated had to be printed.
